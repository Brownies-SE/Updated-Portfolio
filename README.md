# Portfolio

# Description

This is my personal portfolio. It has a header with navigation bar on the right side of the header. Each link will take you to the spot it represents. Below the header I have created an about me section that shows a little bit of my background. Below the about me section, I have three of the biggest projects I have created so far. My contact information is at the bottom.
