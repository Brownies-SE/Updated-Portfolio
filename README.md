# My_Portfolio

# Description

This project was to test the understanding of basic HTML and CSS. This is a mock-up of my first portfolio. There will be many more updated versions to come.
You will find some projects I have worked on recently as well as other from the past. There is a section that includes a little bit of my background and another with
my contact information.
